# Introduction

## Preamble

Before we start I should clarify something about the following tutorials. These tutorials are NOT a step by step guide, how to make a good Engine. They are rather design ideas on how
to get started. Some approaches might render to be useless or even bottlenecks for performance. I take no responsibility for slow code. It's up to you to improve and enrich your code.

All code is written in Java on a Windows 10 base.

## Requirements

To start with an lwjgl engine project in eclipse you will need to get some stuff.

You should arrange the following stuff to be present:

- Eclipse
- Git-Repository
- LWJGL.jar
